# EC327-PAs
Programming Assignments for EC327 Intro to Software Engineering (including Space Race)

EC327 is a course offered by Boston University focusing on C++ and implementation of effective software engineering techniques. This course was taught by Professor Douglas Densmore during the fall of 2017.

Assignments 1 and 2 are broken into smaller simple exercises with C++ that are detailed in their READMEs. Assignment 3 is the preliminary version of the Space Race game, and Space Race is the final improved version of the game. 

Some of the functionality of Space Race can be seen in this video demonstration:
