# PA1
This is the first assignment from EC327.

This assignment focused on the basics of C++ programming. It is divided into four small programs:

Q1 takes input for coordinates of the leftmost and bottommost corner of two different rectangles as well as their dimensions.
It then calculates whether or not these rectangles intersect. It involves error-checking and cin/cout statements.

Q2 is a unit conversion tool. It converts between cups, ounces, tablespoons, and teaspoons. It involves the use of functions, passing arguments, and basic error-checking.

Q3 calculates the hamming distance between two positive integers converted to hex format. This code involves character arrays, type conversion, and conversion of the integers to hex format.

Q4 is a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It involves producing random output for the computer choices using randomly-generated integers.

Q5 "encrypts" and plays with user-inputted characters. The user can choose to change the case, reverse letters, or "encrypt" them by moving the letter forward in the alphabet by 6 places. This involves string manipulation, ASCII equivalents, error-checking, and switch cases.
