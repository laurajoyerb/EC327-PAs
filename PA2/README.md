# PA2
This is the second assignment from EC327. It is divided into three small programs:

Q1 performs a series of numerical operations based on user input. There are 8 command codes. Each performs a different operation and requires different inputs. This problem involves basic error checking, pointers, file I/O, header files, and number manipulation.

Commands:
f - Compute factorial value
b - Compute fibonacci number
r - Compute square roots of a series of numbers
d - Compute odd numbers between two integers
l - Compute natural logs of a series of numbers
n - NyanCat value of a series of numbers (2 * num) + (num * (6)^num)
i - Reads from input file
o - Writes to output file
q - Quits program

Q2 uses file I/O, arrays, statistics, random numbers, and functions. It creates a file, writes random numbers to it, reads these numbers into an array, and performs statistic operations on the array.

Q3 uses recursion to print a rhombus of a user-specified size using numbers.
